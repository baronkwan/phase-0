# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

DBC 1.1 Think about time

Release 1: Reflect

### Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?

> I have learned about how to create a habit by first setting up a tiny goal which is easy to achieve then do it repetitively. On each time add a tiny increment in order to make it grows until it become a habit. Or say “Fake the habit until it becomes a real habit.”

> Another idea I learned is the pomodoro technique/Time Boxing. This idea required user to set up limited timeframes. It let user to stop the work when the time limit is reached and then do an evaluation on what idea or progress was accomplished. This practice will improve my efficiency on works and can harvest success in divided intervals.



### What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

> Time Boxing approach required a person or a team to organized works in a several pre-designed limited time scales. It consists of stopping work when the time limit is reached and then evaluating what was accomplished or learned during each individual timeframe.
In Phase 0, I can employ this idea on each assignment. By doing so I can evaluate what I have been studying and things I might have missed.


### How do you manage your time currently?

> I am currently devoting all my time for DBC. Honestly I did not set up any time management plan for my study. What I am doing now is just study on canvas, break, and study again. Sometime times goes by fast but I feel like the are still room for improvement.

### Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

> My current study habit is not working optimally. Sometime times goes by fast but I feel like the are still room for improvement. After browsing through all those articles about time management and productivity ideas, I found myself in an emergency needs for a time-box idea to time my study and divided them in sessions in order to make my study more efficient.

### Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?

> I would like to employ the time-box idea to manage my study and divided them in sessions. I imagine my plan will first start out by setting up small time boxes and put an increment on each of them everyday. I believe this practice will not only help me to learn things more efficiently, but also make me become more focus on my projects.

### What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

> My overall plan for Phase 0 time management would be simple. First of all, prioritized the assignments if they are not sequential. Then, set up specific time-boxes for each assignment allowing myself to take breaks and evaluate what I have been working on and how to improve the way I do it. Finally, quickly review all materials to refresh my memories.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

DBC 1.2 The Command Line

Release 2: Reflect
 
### What is Shell?
> In Unix or Unix-like system, “Shell” is a software which has specialized to mean a text based command-line interface. It allows user to input commands and execute them.


### What is Bash?
> Bash is a type of shell. Bash is probably one of the most well-known shell nowadays.


### What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
> The commands are pretty straight forward for the most parts except those commands with strange abberviation.  had a moment that trying to remove a directory with the command “rm” rather than “rmdir”. This can be improve by practicing more.


### Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
> Yes, I am able to use all of the commands that mentioned in the Command Line Crash Course.


### In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

> I think the most important commands and arguments to know are

> 1. ```pwd``` uses to print out the current working directory the user is located at

> 2. ```ls``` uses to list all the files and folders under the current working directory. if "ls" is followed by a complete specific directory, it will list all the files and folders under that specific directory.

> 3. ```cd``` uses to change directory from one to another. if ```../``` combined use with ```cd``` makes ```cd ../```. This command will tell the system to go up to the parent directory of the current working directory.

> 4. ```man [command]``` uses to look up the information and the usage of the command.

> 5. ```grep [strings] [filename]``` uses to search the given file ([filename]) for lines containing a match to the given strings ([strings]) and displays the matching lines. Combine use of ```cat``` and ```|``` with several files ( ```cat [file1] [file2] | grep [strings]``` ) can display a combined result of search on file1 and file 2.



### Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

| Command | What it does |
| ------- | ------------ |
| ```pwd``` | to print out the current working directory |
|```ls``` | to list all the files and directories |
| ```mv``` | to move files from one location to another or rename files |
| ```cd``` | to navigate between directories |
| ```../``` | if ```../``` combined use with ```cd``` makes ````cd ../```. This command will tell the system to go up to the parent directory of the current working directory. alone use of ```../``` will results in “-bash: ../: is a directory” |
| ```touch``` |to create a new, empty file or to change the timestamps of existing files and directories |
| ```mkdir``` | to create a new directory under the current directory |
| ```less``` | to display files in pages. It is similar to more, but has the extended capability of allowing both forward and backward navigation through the file |
| ```rmdir``` | to delete existing directories |
| ```rm``` | to delete files |
| ```help``` | to access the help menu which shows the usage of commands |
 


# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

DBC 1.4  Create, Fork, and Clone Repositories

Release 4: Reflect

### If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? 

> To create a new repo on your GitHub account, you should

> 1.	go to your GitHub profile then navigate to the top right navigation bar.

> 2.	You should see a “+” next to your avatar/profile picture. Click on “+” and then select “New Repository”. This will bring you to a new repository page.

> 3.	On the new repository page, you should give a name to the new repository. Then select “public” for your repository visibility and add any license of your choice.

> 4.	Click “Create Repository” to complete your creation of your new repository.

> To fork a repo from another GitHub user’s repository. you should

> 1.	go to the user’s repository.

> 2.	Click “Fork” button at the top right corner of the repository page which should be right below the “+” button.

> 3.	Then a window will pop up and select which GitHub account you want to fork (copy) the repository to.

> 4.	Once the repository has been forked, you will be redirected to your forked version (copy) of repository.


> To clone a repository from your remote GitHub repo to your local computer. You should

> 1.	open your terminal to see if your current working directory is at the location where you want to store your copy of remote GitHub repo. Use “pwd” and “cd” to relocate your working directory.

> 2.	Then jump back to the repository page you want to clone. Look for and copy SSH URL/HTTPS URL to your clipboard.

> 3.	Jump back to your terminal, type in “git clone SSH URL/HTTPS URL” with the URL link you just copied to the clipboard.

> 4.	Repository should be cloned to the current working directory at this moment.


### Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?

> Forking a repository will create a copy of a repository on the user’s selected account.
Forking another user’s repository allows developers to use existing codes so that they can focus on contribute to the project to make meaningful progress. It is so much more efficient to modify a wheel to suit their use than reinventing the wheel.



### What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? 

> When I first try GitHub I messed up Fork and Clone a repository. Don’t know where to start. Don’t know where to find the SSH URL/HTTPS URL.


### What did you learn in the process?


> In this section I learn how to use GitHub to create, Fork, and Clone repositories. Creating my own GitHub account so that I can share my files with other GitHub user on the GitHub platform. Forking a repository allows me to make my own remote copy of that repository on my GitHub account. By then I can clone (download) that remote repository to my local computer.
