# DBC 1.6 You Website, Part 1

Release 5: Reflect


### Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

> [Here is my very own github.io](https://baronkwan.github.io)


### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

> To create a repository on Github, you need to

> 1.	Visit your Github profile, navigate and click to the top right corner for "+" sign, then click on  "New repository" to get to the "Create a new repository" page.

> 2.	Enter your choice of repository name, remember to double check the spelling. Check "Public" if your allow everyone have access to see this repository. Check "Private" if otherwise applied.

> 3.	It is your option to initialize a README file and adding a license. If everything is in your favor. Click on the green "Create repository" button to complete the creation of the new repository.

> To clone the repository to your local computer, you need to

> 1.	Look for the SSH URL/HTTPS URL on the repository page that you want to clone and copy it to your clipboard.

> 2.	Open your terminal on your local computer, change your current directory where you would like to clone the repository to. Type in ```git clone SSH-URL/HTTPS-URL```. Replace the ```SSH-URL/HTTPS-URL``` with the URL your just copied on your clipboard.

> 3.	And then press enter. Once the command done, you can see the selected repository shows up under your current directory locally.


### Describe what open source means.

> Open Source means the code and the source code of the software are able to be freely distributed. Open source software is the practice of sharing how a computer program was made and also allowing others to use, customize and build on the software as they see fit.


### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

> I love the idea of Open Source. It makes me feel great, like living in a utopia. To me, in some sense, the culture of Open Source allows people on the world, regardless which part, to share their knowledge and ideas in a selfless way. People can avoid reinventing the wheel based on existing ideas made by pioneers. However, some people with bad intention take advantages of the core idea of Open Source. Disturbing the Open Source community to grow as expected. That's why licensing creator's work becomes more and more important. It make me feel protective when the licensing is done right.


### Assess the importance of using licenses.

> Using licenses can protect the original creator, making sure he/she at least get some credit for his/her contributions. Licensing also prevent others from claiming the creator's work as their own. Allowing the creator focus on designing or developing rather than spending time dealing with copyright/permissions issues.


### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

> In this challenge, I was expecting to see my own website come alive after I click on the "Create repository". I tried a few times put in my own github.io address in my browser but only saw a message with 404 error. I was struggled, "What I did wrong!". But then, I moved on and look at the next release. I realized I need the index.html on my repository to show my first github.io web page!. This is my "aha" moments. I learnt to try to digest the material first, don't rush to make things done.


### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

> I found an amazing, inspiration site which teaches me the git branching in a vivid way.
