<!-- Add your reflection here -->
<!-- # This challenge took me [#] hours. -->
<!-- 
What did you learn about the DOM?

I learned about how the DOM can be combine with other scripting language to become an API.
Also the way that DOM was structured allow us to treat every node/element as an object so that we can get
access to add, modify or delete the properties and attributes of the HTML document.


What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?

I think the most useful method would be document.getElementsById and get.ElementsByClassName. They can allow us to
get access to specific html tag with unique id or common class name. -->
