- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It works like magic! So what html does is helping you to deliver your messages on the broswer with the use of different magical tags in an interesting way.


- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

It was easier than I thought. As we now have everything online, what I did when researching HTML5 elements is just googling. Google is unbeatable.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I will always close a tag right after I created one. I also pay attention on indentation so that I won't get lost when I am currently located myself at.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

What is good about HTML is how simple the way it is. All you need to do is inserting right content into the right tags.
The bad side about it has to be lack of good styling property. Maybe that's how CSS is introduced.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I always close the tag right before I created one, then I will move my cursor in between the tags and do my work.
