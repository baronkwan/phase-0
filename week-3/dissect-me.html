<!-- 
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

I used <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <link> , etc. in this challenge and am intended
to continue to use them. They are html5 semantic elements which are more descriptive than the old industry standard heavily use <div> tag. It allows reader to easily locate where they were looking at instead of looking for the classes and ids.


How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The content inside the pair of <body> tag get laid out on a page. The browser read the html file from
top to bottom.


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

i learned how to create a handy snippet. It was a great tool for some repetitive typing. I will absolutely create more sinppets in the future date.
