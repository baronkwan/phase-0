# DBC 3.4 Chrome DevTools

Release 4: Reflect


### How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

Chrome DevTools inspector is good for practicing and testing new idea when you are trying to format or positioning the html elements. It will interacting with your typing to show you the way the CSS/html look on the browser. And if you would like to start over again you can simply refresh the page and it will automatically return to the default setting. In short it provided live-edit CSS/html through the chrome's browser.


### How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

Select the elements you want to change, typing in ```height``` / ```width``` along with the sizes in any number of px or em you like. It will show up on the browser immediately.


### What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?




### What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?




### What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I really appreciate this challenge. CSS positioning is a topic that need real practice. The concept is not hard but in order to place elements as you planned is not an easy task. This challenge allowed me and my pair to go through different scenarios together and try to solve problems together. It was good to have someone to talk to when you are solving a problem.
